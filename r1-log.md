# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Angelica Nicolle Abalos

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Wednesday, November 22, 2017].

## Log

### R1D1: November 22, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Worked on freeCodeCamp tribute page project and completed desktop version in CodePen.

**Thoughts:** I plan on coming back to this project to be able to optimize it for tablet and mobile devices so it looks great on my portfolio. After not coding for over a year, it took a lot of looking things up on Google, but I feel like I'm starting to remember things again. I think committing to 100 Days of Code will really help me build up the discipline to keep at coding this time around.

### R1D2: November 23, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Forked the [original #100DaysOfCode repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) to create this log for the challenge. Also created an HTML outline for my next project, which is the freeCodeCamp portfolio. I'll be working on the project mostly through Github and publish the final piece to CodePen.

**Thoughts:** I've never worked with Markdown before, so I'll definitely be looking into that a little more now that I have this log. It's also weird to be starting all over again on a portfolio project since I was working on something similar about a year ago. But since I forgot most of how to do it, I know it's best to start from scratch and work my way back up.

### R1D3: November 24, 2017
**Today's Progress**: While I was browsing for inspiration for the fCC portfolio project, I stumbled upon a link to a DevTips playlist on YouTube. A few videos in, I decided I would try to follow along with his Jekyll basics video. I ended up spending some time using Terminal troubleshooting and re-installing Xcode, Homebrew, etc just so I could install Jekyll again. For whatever reason it wasn't properly installed from last time, but I finally figured it out today.

**Thoughts:** After going through all that hassle and messing around with Jekyll a bit, I decided I was being too ambitious for right now and I need to focus on my current task of re-learning HTML and CSS (however basic it feels right now) and really understand and code comfortably with them before I try to go too advanced.

### R1D4: November 25, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Built out a portfolio site for fCC's challenge with Bulma today.

**Thoughts:** It was my first time using Bulma, but so far I prefer it over Bootstrap mainly because it's minimal, straight forward and easy to understand. Styling is a bit weird though, so I'd like to mess around with it a little more to see how that works

### R1D5: November 26, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Mainly focused on learning today via tutorials on fCC, Odin and Codecademy, as well as posts on Medium and Quora. I started the Javascript section on fCC, but I jumped back to HTML/CSS after that.

**Thoughts:** I'm still trying to figure out what my learning schedule should be. A part of me wants to solidify my foundation in HTML/CSS until I'm comfortable before I move on to JS, but another part of me feels like I should just go for it. JS is definitely not as easy to get into.

### R1D6: November 27, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Spent a lot of time reading articles today, but also tested out a new study strategy. I also came across a [Command Line tutorial](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/a-command-line-crash-course) that I actually enjoyed.

**Thoughts:** The new "study strategy" is honestly just the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), but considering the number of resources/subject I'm trying to learn, this method makes sense to implement. The Viking Code School's [Command Line Crash Course](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/a-command-line-crash-course) really made learning the command line fun and not at all daunting like other resources I've tried. I feel like I learned more and will be able to comfortably work in my terminal now.

### R1D7: November 28, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Revisited the tribute page project in an attempt to make it a responsive layout. In the process of finalizing. Committed initial changes to Github repo and re-uploaded to CodePen.

**Thoughts:** Now that I've done this, I feel a little more confident in revisiting the portfolio project I recently created to make it responsive without relying on any frameworks. I shared the link on Twitter to ask for constructive criticism and got a really helpful response, so I'll definitely be doing that again.

### R1D8: November 29, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up tribute project code by removing duplicates and re-organizing CSS. Also wrote a new blog post using markdown.

**Thoughts:** I'm really liking markdown. I think my next step is gonna be to learn how to create a jekyll site and theme in order to maintain a blog using markdown.

### R1D9: November 30, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Today I spent a couple hours trying to recreate the Google homepage. I still need to go back and get the layout just right, but so far so good.

**Thoughts:** I've been studying using [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and I really love the set up. Coding on my own laptop rather than on a setup like Codecademy is really helpful for me to not just rely on a site to spit out the correct answers if I need a hint. I have to make the extra effort to find out what I need, and I'm learning a lot more through this process.

### R1D10: December 1, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Hacked away at my computer a bunch today. Finally completed the Google homepage project from TOP to the best of my abilities. Also, updated my coding portfolio and launched it via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). I attempted to make my [design portfolio](http://angelicanicolle.com) a Jekyll site, but I didn't quite make it work.

**Thoughts:** Jekyll is something that would make my development process way easier, especially with my design portfolio's theme. I am determined to learn that along with Sass so I can speed up my workflow.

### R1D11: December 2, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Set up my [design portfolio](http://angelicanicolle.com) with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and updated some of it's content. Also started the Javascript portion of TOP. I attempted the [current course material](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-basics?ref=lnav), but struggled with it. I found that the [beta material](https://the-odin-project.gitbooks.io/javascript-curriculum/content/JS101/introduction-101.html) so far is much more thorough and easy to wrap my head around.

**Thoughts:** I'm definitely going to try to take the next wave of learning slowly. I really want to be able to thoroughly understand the language and work with it comfortably.

### R1D12: December 3, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Spent the day trying to learn Javascript with TOP.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying not to get too frustrated with the fact that I can't easily wrap my head around this language. I tried to look for a few ways to learn JS and found a few sites that gamified this process, so we'll see how that works.
