## Log

### R1D1: November 23, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Worked on freeCodeCamp tribute page project and completed desktop version in CodePen.

**Thoughts:** I plan on coming back to this project to be able to optimize it for tablet and mobile devices so it looks great on my portfolio. After not coding for over a year, it took a lot of looking things up on Google, but I feel like I'm starting to remember things again. I think committing to 100 Days of Code will really help me build up the discipline to keep at coding this time around.
