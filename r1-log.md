# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Angelica Nicolle Abalos

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Wednesday, November 22, 2017].

## Log

### R1D1: November 22, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Worked on freeCodeCamp tribute page project and completed desktop version in CodePen.

**Thoughts:** I plan on coming back to this project to be able to optimize it for tablet and mobile devices so it looks great on my portfolio. After not coding for over a year, it took a lot of looking things up on Google, but I feel like I'm starting to remember things again. I think committing to 100 Days of Code will really help me build up the discipline to keep at coding this time around.

### R1D2: November 23, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Forked the [original #100DaysOfCode repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) to create this log for the challenge. Also created an HTML outline for my next project, which is the freeCodeCamp portfolio. I'll be working on the project mostly through Github and publish the final piece to CodePen.

**Thoughts:** I've never worked with Markdown before, so I'll definitely be looking into that a little more now that I have this log. It's also weird to be starting all over again on a portfolio project since I was working on something similar about a year ago. But since I forgot most of how to do it, I know it's best to start from scratch and work my way back up.

### R1D3: November 24, 2017
**Today's Progress**: While I was browsing for inspiration for the fCC portfolio project, I stumbled upon a link to a DevTips playlist on YouTube. A few videos in, I decided I would try to follow along with his Jekyll basics video. I ended up spending some time using Terminal troubleshooting and re-installing Xcode, Homebrew, etc just so I could install Jekyll again. For whatever reason it wasn't properly installed from last time, but I finally figured it out today.

**Thoughts:** After going through all that hassle and messing around with Jekyll a bit, I decided I was being too ambitious for right now and I need to focus on my current task of re-learning HTML and CSS (however basic it feels right now) and really understand and code comfortably with them before I try to go too advanced.

### R1D4: November 25, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Built out a portfolio site for fCC's challenge with Bulma today.

**Thoughts:** It was my first time using Bulma, but so far I prefer it over Bootstrap mainly because it's minimal, straight forward and easy to understand. Styling is a bit weird though, so I'd like to mess around with it a little more to see how that works

### R1D5: November 26, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Mainly focused on learning today via tutorials on fCC, Odin and Codecademy, as well as posts on Medium and Quora. I started the Javascript section on fCC, but I jumped back to HTML/CSS after that.

**Thoughts:** I'm still trying to figure out what my learning schedule should be. A part of me wants to solidify my foundation in HTML/CSS until I'm comfortable before I move on to JS, but another part of me feels like I should just go for it. JS is definitely not as easy to get into.

### R1D6: November 27, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Spent a lot of time reading articles today, but also tested out a new study strategy. I also came across a [Command Line tutorial](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/a-command-line-crash-course) that I actually enjoyed.

**Thoughts:** The new "study strategy" is honestly just the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), but considering the number of resources/subject I'm trying to learn, this method makes sense to implement. The Viking Code School's [Command Line Crash Course](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/a-command-line-crash-course) really made learning the command line fun and not at all daunting like other resources I've tried. I feel like I learned more and will be able to comfortably work in my terminal now.
